# Dalamud Plugins
Contains the repository JSON file for my Dalamud Plugins for third party plugin support.

## How to use
* Access Dalamud's settings by typing `/xlsettings` in the chat window and pressing enter.
* Click on the "Experimental" tab.
* Copy and Paste in the following URL into one of the blank inputs under the "Custom Plugin Repositories" section: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CharlieDelune/DalamudPlugins/master/repo.json
* Click the "+" button to add it to the list.
* Check the "Enabled" box for your new entry.
* Click "Save and Close" at the bottom.

From here, you can now install my plugins from within the game by typing `/xlplugins` in the chat and hitting enter.
Now, just select one of my plugins you wish to install like normal, and click "Install".
All of my plugins are tagged with my username "GlassLionCharlie", so you can enter that in the search field to see all of the plugins I've created.
